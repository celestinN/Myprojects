<h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
NIRDA
Reinventing Industries
Technology Acquisition, Commercialization, and Transfer
Overview

Technology acquisition, commercialization, and transfer: NIRDA supports partner enterprises in selected value chains to help them improve their competitiveness through the acquisition and commercialization of appropriate technologies.

We support the replication of successful pilot projects by a large number of private enterprises and we link enterprises with global technology trailblazers in order to create sustainable enterprises that will stimulate economic development in Rwanda.

 

The India-Rwanda Innovation Growth Programme, www.irigp.org
The India Rwanda Innovation Growth Programme (IRIGP) is a technology transfer programme which was launched during the State Visit of the former Vice President of India, Shri Hamid Ansari, as one of the major Science and Technology initiatives between India and Rwanda. The Government of India’s Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI), on behalf of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), is implementing the programme in partnership with NIRDA.

The India-Rwanda Innovation Growth Programme is a ﬁrst of its kind initiative to be launched and piloted between India and Rwanda to strengthen the bilateral relationship purely based on Science, Technology and Innovation. The objective of the Programme is to match the socio-economic needs of Rwanda by linking the Rwandan industry with leading edge Indian technologies and innovations. The Programme will deploy 20 demonstrated and validated Indian technologies and innovations over a period of two years, leading to 20 sustainable enterprises that will stimulate economic impact development in Rwanda.

In alignment with the above-stated objectives, a database of over 230 Indian tested technologies has been created and readily available for Rwanda's private sector utilization. A total of ten Indian - Rwandan enterprises were matched and business engagement agreements have been signed for Indian technology acquisition. The matched enterprises were in areas of: ICT, health, agro-processing, leather and energy value chains.

The second year of the programme is yet to start under the ﬁnancing of the Indian Government. It will focus on Indian technology transfer in the areas of energy, wood, garments, fruit and vegetable value chains.

Cleaner Production and Climate Innovation Center

Since the elaboration of Vision 2020, the Government of Rwanda has always been committed to environmental protection and promotion of a green economy. The greening of industries is a method to attain sustainable economic growth and promote a sustainable environment. It includes policy making, improved industrial production processes through resource eﬃcient productivity, enhanced environmental compliance and the use of climate innovation in adaptation and mitigation programmes for human health and sustainable development in diﬀerent sectors.

The proposed Cleaner Production and Climate Innovation Center will bridge a gap between Government interventions to boost local industries, and the use of more resource eﬃcient and cleaner production principles. The main mission of the center will be to become a one

stop center of excellence which provides and promotes cutting edge, modern access to green technologies and business services.
